We don't need to import the UserContextProvider in the Login and Profile components. The reason is that the UserContext itself is already importing and exporting the UserContextProvider.
When you import UserContext in the Login and Profile components, you're essentially getting access to the context API, which includes the UserContextProvider. The UserContextProvider is the one that wraps the components and provides the user state and the setUser function.

By importing only the UserContext, you're able to use the useContext hook to access the user state and the setUser function, without needing to import the UserContextProvider explicitly.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

In the UserContext file, you're creating the context using React.createContext() and exporting the UserContextProvider as a part of the context API.
In the Login and Profile components, you're importing the UserContext and using the useContext hook to access the user state and the setUser function.
The UserContextProvider is already being used to wrap the app or a specific section of the app, making the user state and the setUser function available to all components within that scope.
So, by importing only the UserContext, you're able to tap into the context API and access the user state and the setUser function, without needing to import the UserContextProvider explicitly.
